4/13/23 4:30pm Created classes and math for basic 3d rendering. The terminal displays a sphere
4/14/23 10:43am Added camera movement with key inputs. switched ray marching to ray tracing. The program renders a list of triangles
4/14/23 11:18am fixed triangle normals
4/14/23 1:23pm added shadows
4/14/23 9:55pm added .obj file parser to load in 3d objects
4/15/23 11:58pm created Oct tree class for spatial hashing (collision optimization)
4/17/23 3:40pm user can randomize light position
4/18/23 11:00pm collisions are now spatially hashed. it runs much faster, but with bugs
4/19/23 10:44am fixed invisible triangle bug
4/19/23 10:52am re-added shadows with optimized code
4/22/23 2:21pm fixed "blindspot" bug caused by hashing. optimization is done


bugs:
sometimes camera rotate keys (< >) don't work

render "blindspot" bug from spatial hashing

more models

more color shades. include light gray and dark gray printing
